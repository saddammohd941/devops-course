############# CONDITIONS #############
---> whenever we have different scenarios, we put conditions according to the scenario

when statement

sometimes you want to skip a particular command on a particular node

now go to ansible server create a playbook with name conditions.yml

[ansible@ip]# vi conditions.yml

--- # conditions playbook
- hosts: all
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
     - name: install apache on debian
       command: apt-get -y install apache2
       when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
     - name: install apache for redhat
       command: yum -y insatll httpd
       when: ansible_od_family == "RedHat"

esc ---> :wq!

now execute playbook

[ansible@ip]# ansible-playbook conditions.yml


############## VAULT ###############

---> Ansible allows keeping sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than a plaintext in your playbooks 

---> Creating a new encrypted playbook 

[ansible@ip]$ ansible-vault create vault.yml

---> Edit the encrypted playbook 

[ansible@ip]# ansible-vault edit vault.yml

---> To change the password

[ansible@ip]# ansible-vault rekey vault.yml

---> To encrypt an existing playbook 

[ansible@ip]# ansible-vault encrypt target.yml

---> To decrypt an encrypted playbook

[ansible@ip]# ansible-vault decrypt target.yml
